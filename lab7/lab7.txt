The aim of this laboratory exercise is to design and train a Message-Passing
Neural Network (MPNN) model that can categorize a protein into its
corresponding CATH super-family, using its sequence and structure as input.
Moreover, implement a small experiment to evaluate the performance of your MPNN
model.

To ensure your comprehensive understanding of MPNN layers, you will need to
create your own implementation of MPNN layers from MessagePassing layers. This
implies that you cannot directly utilize other graph neural network layers
provided by PyG (or other PyTorch Geometric libraries).

These reference articles introduces MPNN models for structure-based protein
design and prediction tasks.  Feel free to architect your own CNN model, even
if it diverges from the one detailed in the research paper.


#### WARNING ####

You are requested to configure your program to utilize only one GPU. The use of
multiple graphics cards is strictly prohibited for all labs. To illustrate, the
command below can compel your software to employ only the first GPU device.

export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
