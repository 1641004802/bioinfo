The aim of this laboratory exercise is to design and train a Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) model that can categorize a protein into its corresponding
CATH super-family, using its sequence as input. Moreover, implement a small
experiment to evaluate the performance of your CNN model.

To ensure your comprehensive understanding of convolutional layers, you will
need to create your own implementation of convolutional layers from dense
layers. This implies that you cannot directly utilize the convolutional layers
provided by PyTorch or TensorFlow.

#### nbt22pfam.pdf ####

This is a scholarly article published in Nature Biotechnology in 2022, used as
a reference, detailing the classification of a protein into its Pfam family.
Feel free to architect your own CNN model, even if it diverges from the one
detailed in the research paper.


#### train.out ####

An example output from training a CNN model for the purpose of categorizing a
protein into its respective CATH superfamily. Again, it's your responsibility
to design a sensible experiment to assess your model. It's not obligatory to
adhere to the example provided.


#### WARNING ####

You are requested to configure your program to utilize only one GPU. The use of
multiple graphics cards is strictly prohibited for all labs. To illustrate, the
command below can compel your software to employ only the first GPU device.

export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
